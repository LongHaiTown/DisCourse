 This property is directly derived from the definition of the bond measure, and proof is therefore omitted. Now, consider the construction of the utility-list of an itemset Pxy by the Construct procedure (Algorithm 3). As mentioned, a first modification to this procedure is to create the disjunctive bit vector of Pxy by performing the OR operation with the bit vectors of Px and P y before Line 1. This allows obtaining the value support(Pxy) = jbv(Pxy)j. A second modification is to create a variable maxSupport that is initialized to the conjunctive support of Px (support(Px) = jbv(Px)j, before Line 1.
